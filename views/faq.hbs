               How can I adopt an animal from PAWSter Care?
            </h3>
            <p class="post-meta">
                Applicants go through a screening process to ensure that our rescued animals go to loving homes. The process includes a meet a greet with your prospective pet, three (3) separate visits to bond and get to know your chosen animal, and finally, an ocular inspection of your home.

                How can I volunteer for PAWS?
              </h3>
            <p class="post-meta">
               PAWSter Care often needs people to come and help with animal care, but volunteers may also be asked to do out-of-shelter tasks. Volunteers are always welcome as long as you have the right qualities and attitude of being responsible.

              </h3>
            <p class="post-meta">
                Yes, your account would be needed when you decide to adopt a dog so that we could personally track your adoption requests and also if you are capable of adopting and caring for your own dog.

               After submitting an adoption form, we will contact you in regard to the dog that you wish to adopt. You may also reach out to us directly for a follow up on your pending request.

                How Do I Meet a Pet I See on PAWSter Care?
            </h3>
            <p class="post-meta">
                Once you find a pet you’re interested in adopting, you’ll probably want to meet him or her. Go to the Meet The Dogs page and click on the pet’s picture and this will take you to the pet’s detail page.

                Why wasn't I approved to adopt a dog?
            </h3>
            <p class="post-meta">
                Here in PAWSter Care we have sets of Policies and Protocols that we follow and if only one of those were not met you may not adopt a dog. We hope you won’t let this one experience change your mind about providing a loving home to a pet in need. Thank you for helping an adoptable pet and we wish you the best of luck in your search to find a new member of your family.
